      <p>City of None was my first experience working in sound for film. For this project I worked as the head sound superviser, responsible for multiple tasks during the filming and post-production processes. Collaborating with another fellow sound editor and a singer for the music. </p>
      <p>I was responsible for the following:</p>
      <ul class="filmlist">
        <li>Dialogue Recording</li>
        <li>Foley</li>
        <li>Audio Editing</li>
        <li>Sound Design</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Mixing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The film focus on a single character, floating from place to place in a big city, suffering through the dueling isolation that society can cause. Through the narrative of the film this mysterious character has to confront the might of the city, challenged by surreal nightmares and distant echoes. Music and sound design-wise this was a challenge for me, as I had to situate myself in that atmosphere and feel the emotions the character was experiencing.
