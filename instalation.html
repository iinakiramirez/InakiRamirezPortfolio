            <p>The Synthetic Garden is the title of my debuting installation, exhibited in the garden of Gallery 46. My installation was exhibited alongside various pieces by fellow sound artists, for the event With Realistic Sound, organised by LCC BA2 Sound Art students. </p>

            <p>The sound installation consists of a generative quadrophonic composition played from four speakers placed in opposite corners of the garden. The speakers are hidden under the scrubs with the purpose of creating an acousmatic effect in the listener. The composition features field recordings that are being re-contextualized by granular synthesis, later modulated by algorithmic modulation, evolving and progressing in a generative manner. Creating a synthetic ecology in which the natural soundscape coexists with digitally manipulated recordings. I used Supercollider as the main tool in the creation of this composition. To adapt it to the four speaker array in the garden I used a Raspberry PI to run the script and send the output to each designated speaker.</p>

            <p>Human advances in computational technology has raised new questions in the conflict of defining reality, bringing to the table concepts such as the simulation theory. For my piece I wanted to explore the conflict of reality in context with the recent and contemporary hybridisation of analogue and digital life, using sound design as my main medium of expression. My objective was to create a space where digital sound synthesis and natural sound environments merge into one ecology. </p>
