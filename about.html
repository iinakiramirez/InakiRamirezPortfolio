        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>Iñaki Ramirez is a Mexican multi-medium sound artist and electronic musician based in London. Algorithmic composition, experimental synthesis and generative practice, are the building blocks in his creative process. Creating rich, atmospheric textures and complex probability-based rhythms to fit multiple spaces and contexts. 
            <br><br>Iñaki’s work could be divided into two main areas, sound designed for video and visual mediums, and live performance and installation. His installations take advantage of the ephemeral qualities of sound, exploiting spaces with multichannel and surround audio. As a musician he explores electronic music and it’s performance, exploring genres such as Techno, IDM and Ambient.
            <br><br>Apart from his creative practice he is equally involved in curating, audio engineering and organising various events that promote experimental audiovisual art.
